║  Ahoy! ya scurvy one. Here be the first issue of this       
║so called magazine. Is my little kink, my strange peculiarity,
║my little thing to do. I do write anything that comes to my
║head in it, so dont expect anything else but that. 
║
║  I tried to start this on March and have a theme for each
║issue but.. well.. it proves its not going to happen this way.

╟────────────────────────────────────────────────────┼
║
║ I'm sitting on the top floor chit chatting with the regulars and
║the owner. The place has 3 floors, private rooms and a beach
║underneath. Built where Planet Ravix once was by the same
║owner, Amnesia is pretty chill, set in space and a futuristic
║setting. Its a nice place to cuddle and hangout with friends,
║plus there a shop with a few vendors you should check that
║too. Give Chip a banana from me if you visit xD He might
║reward you adequately..

║
║ Among the many many places in SL that you can meditate,
║I picked today the Drolma Lhakhang. It is a Tibetan temple, 
║as far as I can understand, a replica from a real temple built
║on 1055, former refugee of Atisha. There is plenty of NCs
║with information about the temple and the practice and on
║the second floor there is a freebies section as well as books. 
║
║Taking the temple as a starting point, if you explore around
║it you will encounter the Free Tibet group, a small market,
║Baggins house, a few rentals (with a relatively good price) and
║a koi pond.. if you go exploring far enough on the surrounding
║parcels.. or sims!

║   3.  Stargates & 􀀃
╟────────────────────────────────────────────────────┼
║
║  I always found those stargates fascinating, even tho TP is
║pretty easy in SL today. So, I used a platform up in the sky,
║over our tea house. I rez the gate, look around, rotate it a bit
║and keep on building around. Less than 10 minutes later, 
║I hear some noise.. Stargate activates, person pops out!
║
║  Thats the beauty of the stargate really. You say, here is a 
║place to come, so come here. It was a random dial that one.
║I slept and next day checked my star gate's logs, I found
║another one had tried to come. This time from Castle Rock
║Correctional Prison. I couldn't hold but go back and check it
║out which led me to end up in some SciFi station up in the
║sky, above the main sim and the prison xD Be sure to check
║the station and wag your tail at Din before.. she locks you up
║on the ground prison premises ;)

║
║  A small parcel, although adequately detailed. Anna, the 
║owner of the Center for Mindfulness is skilled into creating
║detailed spaces and beautiful experiences within her sims. 
║In such a beautiful space, Anna will be holding classes on 
║mindfulness, personally I can assure you its worth it, if you 
║seek for such a thing. A small bamboo oasis to host all of 
║those. Whispers, she even has pedicure chairs..
║
║  The parcel is hosted in Elite Domination sim, and theres a 
║portal to shops worth exploring..

║   5. "Lumiere Noir" by Candy the Kaang
╟────────────────────────────────────────────────────┼
║
║" I logged SL and checked my notices, saw the notice for a 
║free gift at the landing point of Surfers' Bay, so TP'd there 
║quick, grabbed the gift and then headed to 􀀆 to check 
║it and go through the rest of my stupid inventory.
║
║ I arrived and started camming for a place to rez ma stuffs, 
║when my eye fell on a strange building and surrounding 
║gardens. Curious, I flew over it and discovered the memorial 
║garden of Lumiere Noir (who passed away August 2015). 
║His is the picture on a flat prim at the entrance to Ivory 
║Tower, the place he created and produced all the lessons 
║within as library for those interested in initial learning about 
║prims.
║
║ Firstly, I explored the half-round building which houses all the 
║memorials from his friends and the people whose lives he 
║touched here in SL. Then I stood a while at the foot of his 
║statue, pondering how his work here helped and influenced 
║many then, as it still does now. I am a student of Lumiere 
║myself, having taken his lessons from Ivory Tower. I am 
║really grateful to his work.
║
║ I walked the gardens a little, inspecting the other statues 
║and objects that have been left there in memoriam, then 
║headed back towards Natoma sandbox. A mountain looms 
║behind the memorial house, I thought to walk past it down 
║to Natoma. As I rounded the mountainside, I saw a 
║mysterious box set into the wall. It had chinese inscriptions, 
║I click it and saw it offers a TP.... 
║
║  The small oriental style home is sparsely decorated and 
║overlooks a peaceful waterfall....I sat and thought a while, 
║contemplating life in SL and RL...and listened to the sound 
║of the waters falling. I thought to send you here when you 
║log, I think you will find it calming...."
║
║Candy passed me this, I hope she feels okey about me
║posting it on the Barrel.

║   6.  Tai Chi ─ My first destinations
╟────────────────────────────────────────────────────┼
║
║  Many may have tried it but only few have mastered it, some 
║of you might not even know what it is and some others may 
║find no point at all at it. The latter group, well, I guess you will 
║not enjoy this article. 
║
║  For the other two groups of people tho, this article focuses 
║on places to Tai Chi. For those among you that do not know, 
║its a pose ball thingy here in SL where you just sit and Tai Chi. 
║Do look in wikipedia or the rest of the Internet, on what Tai Chi 
║is all about.
║
║First place we visit is the Dripstone Cave in Da Vinci Gardens.
║
║􀀇
║Da Vinci Gardens is a pretty cool sim, if you haven't visited
║already I assure you it's worth it. One of the places you can 
║visit in Da Vinci Gardens is the Dripstone Cave where you 
║can also Tai Chi :) In cave sounds and peacefull music among 
║some prehistoric drawings and who knows what else is in 
║there waiting for you to discover with your camera or yourself. 
║A peaceful and clean place to visit. Make peace with the bats, 
║you've been warned.
║
║From the depths of the Dripstone cave up in space to visit..
║
║􀀈
║Inspire is a 10 year old sim. I met a Linden there once :) A 
║bunch of rocks floating in space where you can Tai Chi, 
║meditate, stand idle and enjoy the view while you listen to 
║some great tunes, iff you go by electronic music. Inspire 
║does a few events and not-so-recently they had a restriction 
║for new accounts, ruling me out for a few days. I love that 
║place, it definately worth a visit if you like to space Tai Chi 
║and it really is the first place that made me love Tai Chi 
║anyways. Do try to walk everywhere, even where you think 
║you couldn't and try cuddling with your beloved in orbit 
║around those big rocks. People there sometimes tend to 
║use particles so boost up with good will and do not be 
║lag grumpy, particles.are.nice.
║
║􀀉
║In this beautiful sim, you can Tai Chi (and cliff dive) in the 
║top of a hill. The sim is a surfer beach, quite easy going 
║and laid back in a good way. Several spots to hang out and 
║nice waves to surf on, do wear your swimming suit or 
║enjoy being naked under the hot sun. You need to click 
║the bird to start the Tai Chi animation sequence ;)
║
║􀀊
║Our last destination is Hikari. A sim full of meditation and 
║Tai Chi Places. Do enjoy the peace there and wave to 
║Moon Fargis the wandering zen monk there. The LM will 
║get you to the Cherrytree Zendo where regular meditation 
║sessions take place, mostly on Sundays :)
║
║
║I have a HUD under development.. a couple of months now
║with more than 20 destinations, this is the article I wrote 
║back then when trying to initially release this issue. However,
║feel free to send any Tai Chi landmarks my way! I like NCs!
