### About this

Dankey Kaang, me, used to type in a notecard in SL and distribute his magazine all happy through his friend list. Once he had finished a few reviews of the sims he had visited and he was content with the extent of his words typed in the notecard, he was distributing his new issue, either they wanted either they didn't, to his friends.

This will happen no more, as me, Dankey the Kaang, decided to turn this into a website, after being inspired by my once upon a time editor Sukio Sudako. You can find her lovely blog [Suki's Adventures: Virtualis Mundi](https://sukisl.wordpress.com/), I highly suggest going through it, she does have some amazing places reviewed there and also if you feel close or in any way her words touch the inner side of your heart or mind, do visit her [Cafe in Secondlife](https://maps.secondlife.com/secondlife/Coral Sands/63/233/21).

That all being said, from this page you can enjoy my own writtings and possibly some contradictory arguments, peculiar point of views or whatsoever I plan to put in here.
