title:  "Lumiere Noir"
---

" I logged SL and checked my notices, saw the notice for a free gift at the landing point of Surfers' Bay, so TP'd there quick, grabbed the gift and then headed to [Natoma](https://maps.secondlife.com/secondlife/Natoma/128/128/0?title=Natoma) to check it and go through the rest of my stupid inventory.

 I arrived and started camming for a place to rez ma stuffs, when my eye fell on a strange building and surrounding gardens. Curious, I flew over it and discovered the memorial garden of Lumiere Noir (who passed away August 2015). His is the picture on a flat prim at the entrance to Ivory 
Tower, the place he created and produced all the lessons within as library for those interested in initial learning about prims.

 Firstly, I explored the half-round building which houses all the memorials from his friends and the people whose lives he touched here in SL. Then I stood a while at the foot of his statue, pondering how his work here helped and influenced many then, as it still does now. I am a student of Lumiere myself, having taken his lessons from Ivory Tower. I am really grateful to his work.

 I walked the gardens a little, inspecting the other statues and objects that have been left there in memoriam, then headed back towards Natoma sandbox. A mountain looms behind the memorial house, I thought to walk past it down to Natoma. As I rounded the mountainside, I saw a mysterious box set into the wall. It had chinese inscriptions, I click it and saw it offers a TP.... 

  The small oriental style home is sparsely decorated and overlooks a peaceful waterfall....I sat and thought a while, contemplating life in SL and RL...and listened to the sound of the waters falling. I thought to send you here when you log, I think you will find it calming...."

Candy passed me this, I hope she feels okey about me posting it on the Barrel.
